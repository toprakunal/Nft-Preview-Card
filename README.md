user @Deepanshu-5288  from Frontend Mentor community helped me with centered items, containers etc. i used his recommendation in this project.

```css
.container{ min-height: 100vh; margin: 0; text-align: center; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; )
```

user @correlucas from Frontend Mentor community helped me with using rem for font-size and "transition: all ease-in 0.5s" attribute. I apply his recommendations in this project. 


Thanks to both!
